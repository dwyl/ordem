# ordenado

A ***Synchronous*** (ordered) **task runner** for Node.js and Browser

## Why?

JavaScript is *synchrnous* and single-threaded, but when multiple
statements are called in succession, **results** ***can*** **be returned** in an
***unexpected order***.
Often we need to run a sequence of tasks in a *specific* order.

We wrote this for [**alvo**](https://github.com/dwyl/alvo) our automated browser test runner. But its useable ***anywhere that runs JavaScript***!
